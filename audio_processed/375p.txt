there is moon ask stay long enough clouds fly away well time coming I am afraid die fading voice sings love cry click time oh time wait fire weeps arm walk bright light sorrow oh drink bit wine might go tomorrow oh love rain fall believe time come reminds pain might leave behind wait fire feel drown name easy know forget kiss I am afraid go go slow
