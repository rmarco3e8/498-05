care long lasts future past write I am control I will choose word melody go along wind streets walk hand hand long sharp wind take breath away again I would run finger hair hair like wheat field I would run through I would run miss miss so gone feel alone miss I would send flower sunflower bright cloud days mess night way top head sunshower kisses felt miss miss so got to do think miss baby I am afraid say miss so
