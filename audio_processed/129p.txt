look morning sun go turn music start day lose familiar song close eye slip away feeling hear old song use play more feeling begin dream more feeling til see marianne walk away see marianne walkin away many people come gone face fade year go by yet still recall wander on clear sun summer sky feeling hear old song use play more feeling begin dream more feeling til see marianne walk away see marianne walkin away I am tire think cold hide music forget day dream girl use know close eye slip away slip away slip away feeling hear old song use play more feeling begin dream more feeling til see marianne walk away see marianne walkin away
