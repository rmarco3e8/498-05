hello darkness old friend I have come talk again vision softly creeping left seed sleeping vision plant brain still remains within sound silence restless dream walk alone narrow street cobblestone beneath halo street lamp turn collar cold damp eye stab flash of neon light split night touch sound silence naked light saw ten thousand people maybe more people talk without speaking people hear without listening people write song voice never share_NEG one dared disturb sound silence fool say i know silence like cancer grows hear word might teach you take arm might reach you word like silent raindrop fell echoed well silence people bow prayed neon god made sign flash warning word forming sign said word prophets write subway walls tenement halls whisper sound silence
