look sad know over life go on old world keep turning let us glad time spend together there is need watch bridge we are burning lay head upon pillow hold warm tender body close mine hear whisper raindrops blowin soft window make believe love one time good times I will get along find another I will find ever need me say word tomorrow forever there will time enough sadness leave me lay head upon pillow hold warm tender body close mine hear whisper raindrops blowin soft window make believe love one time good times
