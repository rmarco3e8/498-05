go walkin midnight moonlight like use do I am always walkin midnight searchin walk mile along highway well that is way sayin love you I am always walkin midnight searchin chorus stop see weepin willow cryin pillow maybe he is cryin me sky turn gloomy night wind whisper me I am lonesome go walkin midnight moonlight hopin may be somewhere a walkin midnight searchin repeat chorus repeat last verse
